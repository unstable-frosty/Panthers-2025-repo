# Introduction
Hello everyone! 
Welcome to our GitHub repository. In this repo, we would be documenting our journey in building our obstacle avoiding car, while also sharing some details about our software, design struggles and how we managed to overcome these challenges. we hope to inspire everyone who reads this documentation and spark a possible idea for their future solutions. thank you for your visit, enjoy the ride!

# Team members
The team consists of two people and a "coach" or as we like to call her at home ✨mum✨.

# experiences passed from different competitions

We are completely self taught developers and this is our first year competing in the future engineering category and our second year competing in the WRO. we have competed in the robomission category, this allowed our minds to prosper with creative designs which highly assist in the mechanical aspect of our robot. not only did we gain an eye for design but competing in line following competitions and breaking a 16 year record in one of them using our lego ev3 and maxing out its using a complex mathematical PD equation. however, still with all these skills, there were still many challenges to be waiting on us, from camera positioning to calibration and quadratic curve equations we have never used before.

# Designing our first robot prototype

for our first design we decided to take things slow and figure out a better and more efficient design, we initially used ackerman steering and a differential with the medium motors stacked on top of each other horizontally and we geared down the steering mechanism using bevel gears. we also used spike wheels for the drive base and the steering. all of this came with a disadvantage firstly the car was way too big and the steering angle was bad due to the size of the wheels.

# prototype v2 vs v1 

for our second prototype we decided for a major change, an upgrade that would flip our car's performance. basically we decided to utilize a bit of the car's height and re-adjust our motors vertically and we removed the down gearing of the steering and using parallel steering with smaller wheels which allowed the angle to turn up to a 100 degrees without limiting the steering and connecting the motor directly to the steering axle with no gears. this came with alot of problems, firstly the steering would either overshoot or undershoot and vibrate way too much. we were in a dilemma for 3 days until we decided to gear down the motor again; turns out the backlash from teh gears would actually make the algorithm way more stable, an imperfection that was just right for our solution.
